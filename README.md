# Daily-Event-Calendar (Working with Third-Party APIs to create a Work Day Scheduler.)

For this project, I created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I also took advantage of the [Moment.js] library to work with date and time. There is a heavy focus on using Moment.js in the browser.

The user can enter in information for any time slot. This information can be saved and/or deleted by selecting the save or clear button at the top of the page. 

The daily event scheduler is color coded based on the user's current time. This dynamic feature helps the user keep track of whether or not they have accomplished their goals for the day. 

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the functionality of this application.
